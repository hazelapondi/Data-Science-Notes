# intros :smile:
This is the beginning of a folder containing varied random stuff to do with data science and its implementation with Python and whatever else.

**Dependencies Imported** (I will update this over time)

*Pandas: this library is used to import datasets and create data frames, which among other things we can use for analysis or prediction. 

*Numpy:a built in python library which helps in doing mathematical functions such as matrix multiplication and conversion.

*Matplotlib: a tool used for data visualization and representation.
