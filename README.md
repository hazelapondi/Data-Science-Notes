# intros :smile:
This is the beginning of a folder containing varied random stuff to do with data science and its implementation with Python and whatever else.

**Dependencies Imported** (I will update this over time)

* *Pandas* is a library used to import datasets and create data frames, which among other things we can use for analysis or prediction. 

* *Numpy* is a built in python library which helps in doing mathematical functions such as matrix multiplication and conversion.

* *Matplotlib* is a tool used for data visualization and representation.

* *%matplotlib inline* is for those using ipython notebook. It ensures the output (graph) is inside the notebook.


**Extras**

* *read_csv* is a function inside pandas library. 
* *train.csv* is a file present in on the anaconda directory. 
* pandas uses *head* function to give us an overview about the top part of the data frame... By default head() returns the first 5 rows of the data frame.
Similarly the *tail* function tail(15) would return the last 15 items.
